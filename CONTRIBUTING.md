If you would like to contribute anything major i'd recommend you just fork the project and if you can try and implement it yourself and submit a pull request.As long as it adds something useful and is not Malware/Malicious ill most likely approve it .I say this because after around 03/10/21 this project will no longer be activley mantained.
If you really would like to contribute to the main project create an issue under the [request] selection and once I go over it I will most likely approve it and try to implement it.
